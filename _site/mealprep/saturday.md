        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
              <p>Bring 2 cups of water to a boil over high heat. Add bulgur wheat and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain carefully.</p>

   <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <p>While wheat cooks, combine parsley, mint, cilantro, garlic, jalape√±o and coriander in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides as ncessary, about 10 to 12 short pulses. Add half of chickpeas and pulse until a rough puree is formed, scraping down sides as necessary, about 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl. </p>
        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        <p>Add remaining chickpeas to food processor and pulse until roughly chopped, 4 to 6 pulses. Transfer to bowl with chickpea/herb mixture. When bulgur wheat has drained, add to bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then fold mixture together, starting with a rubber spatula, and finishing by hand when cool enough to handle. Form mixture into patties roughly 3/4-inch thicka dn 3 inches wide (you should be able to work 8 to 12 patties)</p>

Working one patty at a time, dip in flour mixture to coat, then transfer to breadcrumbs. Cover with breadcrumbs on all sides, then transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining patties.</p>

Add half the patties in a single layer and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until golden brown on bottoms, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip and cook second side, swirling pan occasionally as they cook, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and keep warm while you cook the remaining patties.</p>
         <h3>Step 6:</h3>
